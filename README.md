## Introduction
This is a blog of CH5, with the theme of [TeXt Theme](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme)  (Many Thanks!). The blog is written in English(mainly for practicing my writing English) and then contents are mainly about papers I have read(Reading records) and the records about some tech problems I have met in my daily life(probably with some solutions). I will try to update this blog twice a week. I would like to share all of them in the Internet with MIT license. If you get interested and feel happy, I am glad too. Finally, Welcome to communicate with me by all means(e-mail, comments on github).
