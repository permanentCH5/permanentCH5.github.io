title: How to build this blog?
tags: Problem

This blog was built based on github and jekyll in 7th June, 2020. The blog setup steps are listed as follows:
1. Sign in my Github(permanentCH5) and create a repository(permanentCH5.github.io).
It should be noted that the name of repository should be *your GithubID.github.io*, or
you may not visit your website.
2. Click the *settings* bottom and choose a jekyll theme. Any jekyll theme is OK for I did not use
any of these default themes at all. 
3. Search on the Internet and choose a jekyll theme and I finaly found this theme [TeXt](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme) https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme . I just
cloned it and followed the instructions to build my blog.
4. Github is sometimes difficult for some countries to visit for the Internet reason. Therefore, I bought
a domain name *ch5.top* on Aliyun and apply SSL certificate on this website. Register them on weekdays can be better. I create a file named CNAME wrote this domain name in this file. Besides, on Github settings, I also bundled this domain name with *permanentCH5.github.io* and enforced https visit.
5. The final things to do were to know how to write markdown files and fulfill this blog.

Those above are the main steps to build this blog and seem quite simple. However, it costs me two days to 
set them all well and I feel it is hard. That is the real life.
